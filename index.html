  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
  “No reconnaissance aircraft in history has operated in more hostile airspace or with such complete impunity than 
the SR-71 Blackbird.” (Smithsonian, 2001). During its missions, it has been extremely successful without every taking
hostile damage. The reason of its success is not only due to one factor, which leads to my research question, how has 
the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird’s stealth technology been so efficient throughout its operations?  In this essay, I will 
be covering its main factors and their functions that make this jet “stealthy”. Although it was a success, I will explain 
why such an aircraft has been withdrawn from the military permanently and why it will likely not be used again. The key idea 
of this is to understand how advanced this aircraft was, especially during the time of its creation.

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p class="ex1">
  <pre>
 The Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird is a reconnaissance aircraft which was introduced in January 1964 and headed by 
Clarence L. (Kelly) Johnson (Rich, 1995). The purpose of this aircraft was to obtain intel within the enemy territory, 
but not to sustain itself during combat, thus it does not have any artillery equipped onto it. This jet is two-seated 
and has a twin-engine. Approximately 85% of the plane is made out of titanium and the rest is made of polymer composite 
materials. This also has a vertical tail fin which is made of a laminated plastic-type material, has a Pratt and Whitney 
J58 (JT11D-20B) turbojet engine and uses a Jet Propellant 7 (JP-7) fuel type, which is extremely volatile. This jets maximum 
speed is approximately 2200mph, which is equivalent to 3 times the speed of sound, and it can maintain this velocity for 90min, 
to which after it will require refuelling. This can also achieve an altitude of 16 miles and roam safely around this region. 
All these factors are details that influence in the “Stealth Technology” of this aircraft. Considering how impressive this 
aircraft is for its time, how does it perform so well undercover and what makes it so stealthy?
